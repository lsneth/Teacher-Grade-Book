# Teacher Gradebook

A grade tracking web app made for teachers. Dynamically grabs data from a student data file and an assignment data file. Currently you can enter grades that will color code themselves depending on the score. All info can be saved in local browser storage.

I am creating this app to learn how to use React.

# Future Work

* Edit users/assignment info from UI
* Add tabs for different classes/gradebooks
* User authentication
* Connect to a database instead of using local storage
* Importing/exporting of gradebook pages
